Description: Simplified clone of sipcalc with ipcalc looks
 Netcalc is a slimmed down clone of sipcalc, using the output format of
 ipcalc.  It is written in C and has very few dependencies.  Both IPv4
 and IPv6 is supported.
 .
 Features include:
  - IPv4
   * Classfull and CIDR output.
   * Multiple address and netmask input and output formats (dotted
     quad, hex, number of bits).
   * Output of broadcast address, network class, Cisco wildcard, hosts/range,
     network range.
   * The ability to "split" a network based on a smaller netmask, now also with
     recursive runs on the generated subnets. (also IPv6)
  - IPv6
   * Compressed and expanded input and output addresses.
   * Standard IPv6 network output.
   * v4 in v6 output.
