IP network calculator
=====================
[![Travis Status][]][Travis]

netcalc is a slimmed down clone of [sipcalc][], using the output format
of [ipcalc][].  It is written in C and has very few dependencies.  Both
IPv4 and IPv6 are supported.

The original `sipcalc` project was created by Simon Ekstrand in 2001.
It is no longer actively maintained, but has a lot of features and is
available on major Linux distributions and works on *BSD and Solaris.
